# Medical Record Data Sharing Through Blockchain and IPFS
- Medical record sharing requires privacy, security, and accessibility.  
- Blockchain ensures data integrity with its tamper-proof, decentralized ledger.  
- IPFS (InterPlanetary File System) stores large medical files in a distributed network.  
- Encrypted medical records are stored in IPFS to prevent unauthorized access.  
- Blockchain stores only the IPFS hash, reducing data load and ensuring traceability.  
- Smart contracts manage who can access specific medical records.  
- Patients control their data and can grant or revoke access anytime.  
- Access logs are permanently recorded on the blockchain for transparency.  
- This system enables fast, secure sharing between hospitals and doctors.  
- Overall, it ensures better healthcare outcomes through trusted data exchange.

I’m working on expanding my portfolio, and welcome any feedback or collaboration opportunities!
